> - CRUD functionality for at least one core model  
> - Built-in authentication (login/logout)  
> - Consistent and functional CSS styling  

**Backend (Django)**

- Implement a Django app with clearly defined features.  
- Define Django models to persist data.  
- Provide CRUD functionality (create, read, update, delete) for a core model.

- Apply consistent CSS styling across all pages.  
- Implement responsive design using media queries (mobile-first strongly encouraged).  
- Provide navigation and intuitive user flows for all implemented features.  
- Connect templates with dynamic data from Django views.  

**General Requirements**

- All work must be version-controlled in GitHub.  
- Repository must contain a consistent, meaningful commit history.  
- README must provide setup and usage documentation.  
- Styling must meet minimum standards for clarity and consistency (CSS frameworks not permitted).  
- Data modeling must reflect logical relationships and support application functionality.

### Necessary Deliverables

- **Git Requirements**  
  - One public GitHub repository  
  - Minimum commit count: 20 (must reflect continuous, meaningful progress)  
  - Feature branch workflow required  
  - Commit messages must be clear and descriptive  
  - Pull requests are encouraged for feature integration

### Documentation

Your project README must include the following:  

- Project overview and description  
- Tech stack  
- ERD diagram or equivalent data model documentation  
- Installation guide with all setup steps  
- User stories and/or feature documentation  
- Summary of challenges encountered and solutions applied  

---

### Submission Process

Create an issue ticket in the course repository:  

- Title format: `"FirstName LastName - Capstone"`  
- Include:  
  - GitHub repository link  

After submission, post the issue number in the main Slack channel using:  
`@here Submitted issue #[number]`

### Getting Help

All technical questions must be submitted as GitHub issues. Issues must follow this format:  

```text
I tried ___.
I expected ___ to happen.
___ happened instead.
My repo link is ___ and my question is about lines ___.
```
Issues must remain active. Close issues immediately once resolved, and document the solution in the thread.
Issues without activity for more than 30 minutes will be closed by instructors. Closed issues cannot be reopened; a new issue must be created (include a link to the prior issue if applicable).
