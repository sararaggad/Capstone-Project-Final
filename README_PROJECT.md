### 🟩 MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

The MVP focuses on **Admin + Cars models**, where the admin can perform full CRUD operations.

#### User Stories (MVP)
1. As an **admin user**, I want to log in and log out so that I can access the admin dashboard.  
2. As an **admin user**, I want to view the list of cars so that I can manage them easily.  
3. As an **admin user**, I want to add new cars so that I can expand the fleet.  
4. As an **admin user**, I want to edit car details so that I can keep the information up to date.  
5. As an **admin user**, I want to delete cars so that I can remove unavailable ones.

### 🟦 Bonus Features (Optional)

If additional time is available, the following features will be implemented:

#### User Stories (Bonus)
1. As a **user**, I want to browse available cars with details (model, price, seats, transmission) so that I can choose the right one.  
2. As a **user**, I want to create a booking by selecting start and end dates so that I can reserve a car.  
3. As a **user**, I want to view my current and past bookings so that I can track their status (pending, confirmed, cancelled, completed).  
4. As a **user**, I want to search and filter cars so that I can find what fits my needs faster.
